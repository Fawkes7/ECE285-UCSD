# Assignment 3: Pytorch Segmentation

Assignment 3 includes the following four parts that you need to work through (All inside a single iPython notebook):
1. Implement FCN-32s
2. Train FCN-32s with pretrained parameters
3. Implement FCN-8s
4. Train FCN-8s with pretrained parameters

The dataset can be downloaded by running the script provided in the compress file:

```
bash get_dataset.sh
```

You should run the provided jupyter notebook (Assignment4.ipynb) and write your implementations and answers to the asked questions included in the notebook. Go through the notebook to understand the structure. 

After you complete all the functions and questions, you should upload the following files to Gradescope:

1. Exported PDF of the notebook(You could export Jupyter notebook as PDF in web portal). The pdf must include all the asked results.


#### Instructions on how to use Jupyter notebooks can be found in assignment 1 README file


## Things to keep in mind:
1. Please assign on the relevant pages to repsective question while submitting. We only need to see your code and your final accuracy. 

2. If you added some log for debugging, please remove them before submit.
