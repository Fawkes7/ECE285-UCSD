    "### What is PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a system for executing dynamic computational graphs over Tensor objects that behave similarly as numpy ndarray. It comes with a powerful automatic differentiation engine that removes the need for manual back-propagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. When using a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow you can harness the power of the GPU for your own custom neural network architectures without having to write CUDA code directly (which is beyond the scope of this class).\n",
    "* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n",
    "* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n",
    "* We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch versions\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you are using **PyTorch version >=1.0**. In some of the previous versions (e.g. before 0.4), Tensors had to be wrapped in Variable objects to be used in autograd; however Variables have now been deprecated. In addition 1.0 also separates a Tensor's datatype from its device, and uses numpy-style factories for constructing Tensors rather than directly invoking Tensor constructors.\n",

    "### PyTorch Tensors: Flatten Function\n",
    "A PyTorch Tensor is conceptionally similar to a numpy array: it is an n-dimensional grid of numbers, and like numpy PyTorch provides many functions to efficiently operate on Tensors. As a simple example, we provide a `flatten` function below which reshapes image data for use in a fully-connected neural network.\n",

    "Recall that image data is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x C x H x W, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* N is the number of datapoints\n",
    "* C is the number of channels\n",
    "* H is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n",
    "* W is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

    "PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n",

    "2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n",

    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5; would smaller filters be more efficient?\n",
    "- **Adam Optimizer**: Above we used SGD optimizer, would an Adam optimizer do better?\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster? You can also try out LayerNorm and GroupNorm.\n",

    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",

    "1. Plain conv network does not work good for me, so I try ResNet. The first version is in the previous cell.\n",
    "I greedily tune parameters like learning rate, weight decay rate and learning rate decay rate, to explore the limit of\n",
    "the ResNet architecture. Also, I add data sugmentation including RandomCrop(32,4), RandomFlip, and RandomAffine.\n",
    "However, this architecture just gives around 44% acc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I read the ResNet paper, and find that the common ResNet is not designed for cifar challenge. Instead, it works for imagenet challenge. Cifar is too small(32*32),\n",
    "and will lose a lot of detail through the pooling operation. The author actually proposed another version of ResNet. I adopt the cifar version, and then searched for the optimal paramters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ResNet allows very large learning rate(0.1) for shallow networks. (20 and 34 layers). So I use large learning rate with exponential decay, and train for 100 epoches to test the limit of the ResNet20 network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The val accuracy and loss curve shows that the model converges after 50 epoches. It can meet our 55% requirement after 20 epoches. However, our goal is to train it in 10 epoches.\n",
    "So we should use more aggressive optimization method. I double the initial learning rate, and use smaller batch size(32), so the update will be more aggressive but more unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Take away for training within 10 epoch. => Use small network, large learning rate, add data augmentation, read the orgianl paper(be aware of the restriction of certain architecture)."
