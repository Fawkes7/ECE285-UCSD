# Assignment 2: Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch

Assignment 2 includes the following four parts that you need to work through (All inside a single iPython notebook):
1. Barebones PyTorch three layered Conv net implementation and training
2. PyTorch module API three layered Conv net implementation and training
3. PyTorch sequential API three layered Conv net implementation and training
4. CIFAR challenge with PyTorch

The dataset can be downloaded by running the initial cells of the provided notebook.


You should run the provided jupyter notebook (Assignment2.ipynb) and write your implementations and answers to the asked questions included in the notebook. Go through the notebook to understand the structure. 


After you complete all the functions and questions, you should upload the following files to Gradescope:

1. Exported PDF of the notebook(You could export Jupyter notebook as PDF in web portal). The pdf must include all the asked results. You have to omit/clear up the training logs in order to make the notebook pdf easily readable.


## Instructions on how to use Jupyter notebooks can be found in assignment 1 README file


## Things to keep in mind:
1. Please only assign the relevant pages to each subsection in gradescope. This makes it easier for us to grade and prevents any mis-grading.
